      "question": "How much does a WordPress website cost?",
      "answer": "For a basic WordPress website using standard templates and minimal customization, you could be looking at costs ranging from $100 to $500. This option is ideal if you're just starting out or need a simple blog or small business site. If you're stepping up to a more professional or customized site with premium themes and plugins, prices could rise to between $500 and $2,500. This range suits small to medium-sized businesses that need additional features like SEO tools, custom forms, or e-commerce capabilities.For something top-tier like a large business site or a highly customized e-commerce platform, the cost could easily climb to $5,000 or more. These sites often require extensive custom coding, high-quality design work, premium plugins, and maybe even continuous maintenance or retainer services."
